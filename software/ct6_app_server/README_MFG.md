# CT6 Test and Calibration.
This document details how to install the software onto the RPi Pico W on the CT6 unit, test it and calibrate it.

## Installation of SW
To use the tools to test and calibrate a CT6 unit the Linux package must be installed. 
This installer has to be built first. To build the installer perform the following

```

## Full test and calibration of a CT6 unit.

### Equipment required
- CT6 unit hardware (CT6 board with display connected).
- CT6 AC power supply.
- Micro USB cable.
- AC power meter.
  [E.G ENERGENIE ENE007](https://energenie4u.co.uk/catalogue/product/ENER007)). However it should be noted that the accuracy of this device will govern the CT6 calibration accuracy.
- Linux PC running Ubuntu 20.04 or later.
- [SCT013_100A current transformer](https://www.mouser.com/datasheet/2/744/101990029_SCT_013_000_Datasheet-2487743.pdf)
- [Mains Test Block](https://uk.rs-online.com/web/p/mains-test-blocks/0458926?gb=b)
- AC load that draws at least 5 amps, preferably about 10 amps. A 2kW fan heater can be used for this.

The equipment should be connected as per the diagram shown below.

![alt text](images/cal_system.png "Test/Calibration System")

### CT6 initialisation and calibration

- The ct6_mfg_tool program will load all code onto the CT6 unit, test it and calibrate each port as shown below.
  You must run the ct6_mfg_tool in the software/ct6_app_server folder. Note that '<YOUR WIFI SSID>' and '<YOUR WIFI PASSWORD>' should be replaced with your WiFi SSID and password.

```

## CT6 unit bring up and calibration load.

### Equipment required
- CT6 unit hardware (CT6 board with display connected).
- CT6 AC power supply.
- Micro USB cable.

The equipment should be connected as per the diagram shown below.

![alt text](images/erase_and_bringup.png "Test System")

### CT6 initialisation and loading calibration data

- It is important to understand that the calibration file created in the previous section (/home/auser/test_logs/ASY0398_V01.6000_SN00001823_20240111063130_factory.cfg) is only valid if the same AC PSU is used. It should be possible to use the same type (make/model) of PSU. However at the time of writing I have calibrated each unit with the PSU it will be used with to ensure that the measurement accuracy is as good as possible. The same PSU must be used because the AC line frequency is measured on the CT6 hardware using the voltage across R22 which is derived from the AC supply voltage through the AC -AC transformer and the potential divider of R21 and R22.

This section details how to fully wipe and reload the code on the Pico W and then reload the factory configuration file.

- The steps below show will load all code onto the CT6 unit and test it. You must run the ct6_mfg_tool in the software/ct6_app_server folder. Note that '<YOUR WIFI SSID>' and '<YOUR WIFI PASSWORD>' should be replaced with your WiFi SSID and password.

## Calibrating the AC voltage
If you have a AC-AC power supply that is not the one detailed in the hardware/README.md file then this section can be used to update the voltage calibration after the calibration file has been loaded as detailed in the previous section.

The test system can be setup as per the previous section with the addition of meter to measure the mains AC voltage. 

Note !!!
As mains voltage is dangerous ensure that the wiring is safe to allow the AC voltage to be measured.

The equipment should be connected as per the diagram shown below.

![alt text](images/calibrate_ac_voltage.png "Test/Voltage Calibration System")

Run the following command to calibrate the AC voltage.
