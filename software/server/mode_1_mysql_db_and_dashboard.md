# Using the built in server apps.
The server apps may be installed onto a Linux or Windows machine as
detailed [here](installers/README.md). The following instructions details how to use the ct6_db_store to read and store data to a mysql database. The ct6_dash app can then be used to display the energy usage data stored in the database.

## Setup a MYSQL server
Before starting the apps a MYSQL database is required to store the data from CT6 units. Details of how the MYSQL
database can be setup on windows and Linux platforms can be found [here](install_docker_and_mysql.md).

## ct6_db_store app
This application is responsible for sending messages to CT6 devices on your LAN and saving the responses from CT6 devices to the MYSQL database.

The ct6_db_store app can be started from the command line on Windows (Powershell window) and
Linux (terminal window) platforms.

Before using the ct6_db_store app it must be configured to connect to the MYSQL database.
Start the ct6_db_store app with the -c command line option as shown below to configure
the required settings.

```
ct6_db_store -c


INFO:  Loaded config from /home/username/.ct6DBStore.cfg
INFO:  Saved config to /home/username/.ct6DBStore.cfg
INFO:  ID  PARAMETER           VALUE
INFO:  1   ICONS_ADDRESS       127.0.0.1
INFO:  2   ICONS_PORT          22
INFO:  3   ICONS_USERNAME
INFO:  4   ICONS_SSH_KEY_FILE  /home/username/.ssh/id_rsa
INFO:  5   MQTT_TOPIC          HOME/#

INFO:  8   DB_USERNAME         root
INFO:  9   DB_PASSWORD         changeme
INPUT: Enter 'E' to edit a parameter, or 'Q' to quit:
```

ID's  1,2,3 and 4 can be left at the default values or unset. They are not currently used.

ID 5  Should be set to 'HOME/#'.

ID 6  Should be set to the IP address of the Windows or Linux machine on your LAN.

ID 7  This can be left at 3306 unless the MYSQL docker container is setup for a different port.

ID 8  The database username can be left as root

ID 9  Ensure the password is set to the password used when the mysql docker container was created.

Once this has been completed 'Q' should be entered to quit the ct6_db_tool app.



Once the above configuration is complete the ct6_db_store app must be started without the -c
command line argument as shown below.

```

```

The ct6_db_store is now storing data it receives from CT6 units. If multiple units are found they will be
stored in different databases. The name of each database will be the configured name of the CT6 device.


## ct6_dash app
Once the ct6_db_store app is running the ct6_dash (dashboard) app can be used to start a webserver that
provides GUI access to the data.

Before using the ct6_dash app it must be configured to connect to the MYSQL database.
Start the ct6_dash app with the -c command line options as shown below to configure
the required settings.

```
ct6_dash -c
INFO:  Loaded config from /home/username/.ct6Dash.cfg
INFO:  Saved config to /home/username/.ct6Dash.cfg
INFO:  ID  PARAMETER                 VALUE
INFO:  1   DB_HOST                   192.168.0.22
INFO:  2   DB_PORT                   3306
INFO:  3   DB_USERNAME               root
INFO:  4   DB_PASSWORD               changeme
INFO:  5   LOCAL_GUI_SERVER_ADDRESS  192.168.0.23
INFO:  6   LOCAL_GUI_SERVER_PORT     10000
INPUT: Enter 'E' to edit a parameter, or 'Q' to quit:
```

1 = The host address of the machine running the MYSQL database.

2 = The TCP port number to connect to the database.

3 = The username of the database.

4 = The password for access to the database.

5 = The address of the local machine on your LAN.

6 = The TCP port number to present the web server on.


Once this has been completed 'Q' should be entered to quit the ct6_dash app.



Once the above configuration is complete the ct6_dash app must be started without the -c
command line argument as shown below.

```
ct6_dash
INFO:  Loaded config from /home/username/.ct6Dash.cfg
INFO:  Saved config to /home/username/.ct6Dash.cfg
INFO:  Connected to MySQL server.
```

When the above command issued a local web browser will be automatically started and connected to the ct6_dash webserver.
