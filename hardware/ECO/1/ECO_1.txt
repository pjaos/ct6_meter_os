# Issue
If the AC power is removed and reconnected within about 3 seconds on some
boards prior to V2.1 the ATM90E32 devices did not reset correctly.
If this occured then some channels (usually CT1 - CT3) did not
read AC power.

# ASSY
This ECO can be applied to ASSY0398 CT6 versions 1.6 and 1.9.
When the change is applied the board label should become either 1.61 or 1.91.

# Workaround
If boards prior to V2.1 are powered down they should be left off for at
least 5 seconds before the power is applied again.

# Modification
To resolve this the ATM90E32 device reset pins were connected to a GPIO
pin (19) on the MCU (Pico W). Boards of version 1.6 to 1.9 can be upgraded
to V2.1 by applying the modification below.

1 - Remove C23 and C40
2 - Connect MCU (Pico W) pin 25 (GPI19) to C23 pad that is not connected to GND.
3 - Connect MCU (Pico W) pin 25 (GPI19) to C40 pad that is not connected to GND.

# Status
This modification has been withdrawn because it does not fix the issue when
the power turns off and on very quickly on some boards.
It has been found that if ECO 3 is applied this problem does not occur.
